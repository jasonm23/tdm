# Target Display Mode Service

## Description

This is a very basic Sinatra service which provides a way to toggle
your iMac in/out of Target Display Mode.

#### Installation

Please note, these instructions assume you are running from the
terminal.  To use tdm, clone the repo, run bundle and start the
service script, ie.

    git clone https://github.com/jasonm23/tdm.git
    cd tdm
    bundle

#### Startup

From the folder where you cloned this repository, enter:

    ./tdmservice

The assumption is that you'll want to cancel it when you have your
display back, so there are no instructions for installing this script
as a daemon.
